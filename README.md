## Abstract 
The media player implemented for the major project has various parts that utilize the instruments on the MCB1700 board and the methodologies and programming concepts learned in the course so far. The media centre’s features include a photo gallery capable of displaying various BMP files, an MP3 player that streams audio tracks from the PC and a game center featuring a popular single player game called Flappy Bird. All these parts utilize the LCD panel and joystick of the MCB1700 board.
